				<h1>Brief description</h1>
				
				This plugin allows you to tag other users in posts, this feature is inspired by Facebook, initially it was a modification that i made for a my friend, then i decided after very long time without touching MyBB to package it as plugin!<br />
				This plugin is suitable for forum owners which want to make their forum as a place where it is possible to make virtual relationship between users (like Facebook does).
				
				<h2>The concept</h2>
				
				I think that a forum shouldn't be only a place for discussing but also for estabilishing relationships with other users, my plugin is just one step to accomplish that, now i decided to develop it actively (at least i hope) also for learning more about social network concept.
				
				<h2>Installation and usage</h2>
				
				I wanted the plugin to be easily manageable without requiring to have technical skills, only thing is an issue which may occur with modded templates but i explain how to fix it.<br />
				Read the <a href="usage.html">Usage</a> section.
