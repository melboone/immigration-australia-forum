				In this section i will cover everything you need to know for extending and translating this plugin.
				
				<h2>Hooks</h2>
				
				There are 3 hooks:
				
				<ul>
					<li>tagging_tag_added <span>This hook is called when new tags in a post are added and it has an argument which is an array('pid' => $pid, 'tid' => $tid, 'users' => $users):<br />
					<b>pid</b>: is the post id where users are tagged<br />
					<b>tid</b>: is the thread id which contains the post</b><br />
					<b>users</b>: is an array of user ids of the tagged users
					</span></li>
					<li>tagging_tag_removed <span>This hook is called when some tags are removed in a post and it has an argument which is an array('pid' => $pid, 'tid' => $tid, 'users' => $users):<br />
					<b>pid</b>: is the post id where users are tagged<br />
					<b>tid</b>: is the thread id which contains the post</b><br />
					<b>users</b>: is an array of user ids of the removed tagged users
					</span></li>
					<li>tagging_tag_merged <span>This hook is called when tags are merged (when posts containing tags are merged) in a post and it has an argument which is an array('pid' => $pid, 'tid' => $tid, 'users' => $users):<br />
					<b>pid</b>: is the post id which contains all merged pots<br />
					<b>tid</b>: is the thread tid which contains the post</b><br />
					<b>users</b>: is an array of user ids contained in tags
					</span></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Translation</h2>
				
				English language pack is self-contained, for translating it you need to create a file in <b>/inc/languages/yourlanguage/</b> and name it <b>tagging.lang.php</b>.<br />
				
				This is the basic template of the file:<br />
				<code>
				&lt;?PHP<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_noone'] = "No one";<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_all'] = "Everyone";<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_buddy'] = "Only your buddies";<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_settings'] = "Tagging settings";<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_update_settings'] = "Update your tagging settings";<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_setting_invalid'] = "We're sorry but the setting is invalid, retry!";<br />
				$l['tagging_usercp_setting_updated'] = "You updated successfully your tagging settings";<br />
				?&gt;
				</code>
				
				<br />
				
				Isn't it easy?!
